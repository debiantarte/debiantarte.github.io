This is the first post in a long serie! I will be making posts on the projects I have been working on during my school years, with a mix of school projects and personnal projets. Feel free to explore!

Let's put in some C code.
Just for fun :D

{% highlight C %}
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    printf("Hello World!");
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Hello World!
