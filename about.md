# About me

Hi all! I am Pierre "debiantarte" Bidault, a last year computer science student at [Télécom Sudparis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/en/). 

I have done a 3rd year major in video games and digital collaborations and interactions
(more information [here](https://jin.telecom-sudparis.eu/), though the page is sadly only in french).

You can see a list of my projects on the homepage!
