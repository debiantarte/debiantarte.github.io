# About [Feudal Overlords](https://github.com/debiantarte/feudal-overlords)

Feudal Overlords was the very first game I created that was playable, for a C++ class in computer science. We had to do a game in C++ using only SFML and a limited amount of external libraries.

We also had to avoid singletons and have a well structured class hierarchy.
