# À propos de [Grow & Rest](https://resteam.itch.io/rest-grow)

A FAIRE

--------

**vvv** Version Anglaise **vvv**

Grow & Rest is a contemplative god-game about slimes building structures over time. Once a slime reaches it's destination, it solidifies, becoming a new brick in a greater structure.

The player can choose to just wait and see the little slimes build simple structures, or select a scheme for a more complex one and left click and hold somewhere to make the slimes build the structure there.


The game was made during the Unijam 2019, a game jam hosted by Télécom SudParis for its students. The theme was "Don't be afraid to be slow, be afraid to stop. (chinese proverb)". 

Our team of 4 won the price for the best concept and respect of the theme.
