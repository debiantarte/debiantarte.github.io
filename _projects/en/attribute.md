# About [[attribute]](https://debiantarte.itch.io/attribute)

**[attribute]** was the very first game I made in a game jam that ended up actually playable.
The game jam this was released for had the theme "Only One". So I decided to go for an Action-RPG where you only have one attribute.
So the health decides about your character's strength, speed and defense. 

I had some time management issues for this game, because I spent a little too much time on the graphics and not enough on feedbacks and gameplay elements.

But in the end, this project was playable, and taught me a lot of things. It was also my first time using Unity and coding in C\#.
