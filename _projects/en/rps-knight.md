# About [Knight of Rock & Paper & Scissors](https://hikit.itch.io/knightofrps)

Knight of Rock & Paper & Scissors is a puzzle game where the character goes through the 3 phases of the 'Rock - Paper - Scissors' (which is also the theme of the game jam) trinity. Slimes of the three types roam the dungeon, and the character can only change phase by breaking rocks of the weaker phase than theirs.

I was the only developper on this game, with the other members of my team focusing on game design, graphics, and level design. Being the only developper, I enjoyed the freedom of controlling the architecture of the codebase, while also having the responsibility of integrating every assets on time. The integration phase of the project was very pleasing, because it felt like assembling the pieces of a puzzle I made by myself.
I am very proud that the project reached a pretty much finished state, with a linear progression greatly helped by the fact one of our team members dedicated a good amount of time to the level design during development.

See the github repository for the project [here](https://github.com/debiantarte/weekly-jam-154).
